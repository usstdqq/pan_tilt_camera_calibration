# Pan Tilt Camera Calibration Toolbox

Algorithm details can be found in the following paper:

[1] Dai, Qiqin, Rong Xiong, and Shen Li. "An Optimization Based Vision Calibration Method for PTZ Camera's Errors in Model and Execution." Procedia Engineering 15 (2011): 585-593.

Prepare calibration data to file "calibration_data.log". Each row is a data point. The order of columns is:

theta1 | theta 2 | u | v | x_real | y_real | z_real

Please run file "main.m" to see the process
